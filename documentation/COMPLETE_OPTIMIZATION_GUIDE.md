## üîß **Advanced Configuration Details**

### **Kernel Parameters** (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-memory-intensive-apps.conf`)
```bash
vm.swappiness = 1                    # Minimal swap usage
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50           # Balanced cache pressure
vm.dirty_ratio = 10                  # Optimized write performance
vm.overcommit_memory = 1             # Allow memory overcommit
vm.max_map_count = 262144           # Support complex applications
```

### **System Limits** (`/etc/security/limits.conf`)
```bash
* soft nofile 131072                 # High file descriptor limit
* hard nofile 131072
* soft memlock unlimited             # Unlimited memory locking
* hard memlock unlimited
```

### **ZRAM Configuration** (`/etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf`)
```bash
[zram0]
zram-size = ram / 2                  # 4GB compressed swap
compression-algorithm = lz4          # Fast compression
swap-priority = 100                  # High priority swap
```

## üéØ **Usage Recommendations**

### **Daily Usage Patterns**
- **Normal Operation**: Teams + Chrome (15-20 tabs) + Warp Terminal = **‚úÖ Smooth**
- **Heavy Development**: Add IDEs, Docker, databases = **‚úÖ Manageable**
- **Intensive Research**: Chrome (30+ tabs) + multiple tools = **‚úÖ Optimized**
- **Video Calls**: Teams calls + screen sharing + other apps = **‚úÖ Stable**

### **Memory Management Best Practices**
1. **Use optimized launchers** instead of regular applications
2. **Run memory balancer** when system feels sluggish: `./multi_app_balancer.sh`
3. **Monitor with dashboard** during heavy usage: `./memory_dashboard.sh`
4. **Close unused tabs** regularly (Chrome has automatic tab unloading)
5. **Restart applications** if they've been running for many hours

### **Emergency Procedures**
```bash
# If system becomes slow:
./emergency_system_fix.sh

# If memory is critically low:
./emergency_memory_recovery.sh

# If Chrome is consuming too much:
./chrome_monitor.sh
# Then close unnecessary tabs or restart Chrome
```

## üìà **Performance Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Watch**
- **Available Memory**: Keep above 1GB for smooth operation
- **Swap Usage**: Should stay minimal (< 500MB)
- **Application Memory**: Teams < 2GB, Chrome < 3GB for optimal performance
- **System Load**: Should stay below 4.0 for responsive system

### **Automated Monitoring**
```bash
# Add to crontab for automatic balancing every 15 minutes:
crontab -e
# Add this line:
*/15 * * * * /home/sri/multi_app_balancer.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## üîÑ **Maintenance Schedule**

### **Daily**
- Monitor memory usage during intensive work
- Use memory dashboard when running multiple applications
- Close unused browser tabs

### **Weekly**
- Run complete system optimization: `./advanced_memory_optimization.sh`
- Check memory manager logs: `cat ~/memory_manager.log`
- Restart long-running applications (Teams, Chrome)

### **Monthly**
- Review system performance and adjust priorities if needed
- Update optimization parameters based on usage patterns
- Clean up logs and temporary files

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **Restart Recommendations**
- **Full system restart** recommended after running optimization scripts
- **Application restart** if memory usage seems abnormally high
- **Browser restart** if tab management becomes sluggish

### **Monitoring Guidelines**
- **4GB+ available**: Excellent - can run more applications
- **2-4GB available**: Good - normal operation range
- **1-2GB available**: Moderate - monitor and close unnecessary apps
- **< 1GB available**: Critical - run emergency recovery tools

### **Hardware Upgrade Considerations**
Your current 8GB configuration is **well-optimized** for intensive applications. Consider upgrading only if you regularly:
- Run multiple VMs or containers
- Work with large datasets (> 4GB)
- Need 50+ browser tabs simultaneously
- Use memory-intensive development tools (Android Studio, etc.)
