# Add to crontab for automatic monitoring
crontab -e

# Add these lines for automated maintenance:
*/15 * * * * ~/rpi5-optimization/monitoring/multi_app_balancer.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
0 */6 * * * ~/rpi5-optimization/monitoring/memory_dashboard.sh --log-only >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### Log Monitoring
```bash  
# View optimization logs
tail -f ~/rpi5-optimization/logs/*.log

# Check system health logs
tail -f ~/rpi5-optimization/logs/health_checks.log
```
